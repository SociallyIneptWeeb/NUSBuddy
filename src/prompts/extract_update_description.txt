Given the user's intention to update a project or submission deadline, extract the description of the project to be updated and output in a json format.
The json object should only have the "old_description" key.

Example output:
{
    "old_description": "CS1101S Project Submission"
}

If "old_description" information is missing or not specific, fill in the value as null.
