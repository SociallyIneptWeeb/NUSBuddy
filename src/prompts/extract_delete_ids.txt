Given the user's intention to delete deadlines, extract the ids which correspond to the user's message.
The "confirmation" key is a boolean value that should be false by default.

List of deadlines with ids, description and due dates:
%(deadlines)s

Example output:
{
    "ids": [3, 15],
    "confirmation": true
}

If none of the deadlines in the given list match the user's message, return the following json object.
{
    "ids": [],
    "confirmation": false
}

Only use the above list of deadlines to extract the ids of the deadlines to be deleted.
Only after the user explicitly agrees that the list of deadline "ids" information to be deleted is correct, set the "confirmation" key to true.
The current date and time is %(now)s. Only output the json object.
