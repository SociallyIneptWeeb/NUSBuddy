Given the following information:
1. List of project or submission deadlines with ids, description and due dates
2. User's message to delete deadlines

The json object should only have the following keys: "ids" and "confirmation".
Return the ids which correspond to the user's message and output in a json format.
The "confirmation" key is a boolean value that should be false unless the user agrees that the deadlines to delete is correct.

Example output:
{
    "ids": [3, 15],
    "confirmation": true
}

If none of the deadlines in the given list match the user's message, return the following json object.
{
    "ids": [],
    "confirmation": false
}

List of deadlines:
%(deadlines)s

Only use the above list of deadlines to extract the ids of the deadlines to be deleted.
Only after the user agrees that the specified "ids" to be deleted is correct, set the "confirmation" key to true.
The current date and time is %(now)s. Only output the json object.
