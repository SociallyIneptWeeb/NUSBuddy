Given the user's intention to update a project or submission deadline, extract key information for what the deadline should be updated to.
The "new_due_date" key should be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
The "confirmation" key is a boolean value.

Example output:
{
    "new_description": "CS1101S Project Submission",
    "new_due_date": "2024-11-18",
    "confirmation": false
}

If "new_description" or "new_due_date" information is missing or not specific, fill in the value as null and set "confirmation" to false.
Only after the user agrees that the specified "description" and "due_date" information to be updated to is correct, set the "confirmation" key to true.
The current date and time is %(now)s. Only output the json object.
