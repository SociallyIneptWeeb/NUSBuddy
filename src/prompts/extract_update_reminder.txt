Given the user's intention to update a reminder, extract key information for what the reminder time should be updated to.
The "old_reminder_time" and "new_reminder_time" keys should be in ISO 8601 format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM".
The "confirmation" key is a boolean value.

Example output:
{
    "old_reminder_time": "2024-11-18 08:00",
    "new_reminder_time": "2024-11-18 09:00",
    "confirmation": false
}

If "old_reminder_time" or "new_reminder_time" information is missing or not specific, fill in the value as null and set "confirmation" to false.
Only after the user agrees that the specified "old_reminder_time" and "new_reminder_time" information to be updated to is correct, set the "confirmation" key to true.
The current date and time is %(now)s. Only output the json object.
