You are given a list of deadlines and their descriptions and due dates:
{deadlines}

Given the user's description of a particular deadline, return any deadlines from the list that matched the user's description.
If there are deadlines that match the user's description, return the list of matched deadlines delimited by "\n". Follow the same format as given above.
If no deadlines in the list match the user's description, simply return "No deadlines matched your query".
