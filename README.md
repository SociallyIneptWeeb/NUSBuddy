# NUSBuddy

We hope to build a reliable AI assistant that will keep track of each studentsâ€™ projects and homework submissions. 
Through this, we can explore and learn important prompt engineering techniques, and how to enable an LLM to make database queries and updates. 
It should be accessible and convenient for any student to use, which is why we will be using a Telegram bot written in Python to receive commands from a student.
